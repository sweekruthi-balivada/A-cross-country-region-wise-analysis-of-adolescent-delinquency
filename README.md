# A-cross-country-region-wise-analysis-of-adolescent-delinquency
The research project has amassed country-specific data on diverse delinquent behaviors, encompassing theft, vandalism, violence, and drug abuse. Additionally, it explores various risk and protective factors that potentially impact delinquent behavior. The study involves 31 countries, categorized into six clusters: Anglo-Saxon countries, Northern European countries, Western European countries, Mediterranean countries, Latin American countries, and Eastern and Central European countries. A continuous comparative analysis between these nations aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on delinquency, considering the nuanced variations across distinct socio-economic contexts
